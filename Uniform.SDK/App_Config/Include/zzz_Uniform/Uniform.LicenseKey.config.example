      <!-- UNIFORM - LICENSE KEY
           The setting defines the license key which needs to be obtained for free at
           https://unfrm.io and saved in a separate newly created config file.
           
           Alternatively, it can be saved an app setting or a connection string, 
           or as the UNIFORM_LICENSE_KEY environment variable 
           (after defining environment variable iisreset is required to reflect the changes)
      -->
      <setting name="Uniform.LicenseKey" value="" />

      <!-- UNIFORM - LICENSE KEY - CACHE FILE
           The setting defines the cache file path of the Uniform license key 
           which will be generated after first successful online activation.
           Once the file exists, the Sitecore instance does not need active internet
           connection for Uniform to validate license.
